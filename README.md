# Verify Student

This repo is made courtesy of my learning on TOP(The Odin Project). It's a simple system designed to verify if you are a student and also enables you to create a student record (temporarily). You can experience a live Demonstration at [Verify Students](https://littledannie.github.io/Verify-Students/)

## Aim

This is not a full demonstration of **JavaScript** but it is aimed at helping me understand `function` better.

## Default Student

You can use the already saved record to verify:
- **Username:** ---- Error-Code
- **Age:** ---- 18
- **Level:** ---- 300
<br/>
    you can also go ahead and create your own student. Any Record you create is only temporary and disappears if you reload the page.
_Enjoy the Fun and play around_

> ## Note:
> It might not be the best demonstration of a already working system out there but have it in mind that all code written on this repo is just my knowledge of **JavaScript** at this point. If you are eager to know how much I have learnt before I wrote this code then you can take a look at my current progress [Fundamentals Part 3](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-3).
> *To outline it better this is my current knowledge at this moment:*
> ### Knowledge Tree
> - HTML(Basic)
> - CSS(Basic)
> - JavaScript:
> Since all this is more about **JavaScript** I will properly outline what I have learnt
>   - Variables
>   -  Types
>   - Strings and Numbers
>   - Conditional Statements
>   - Logical Operators
>   - Ternary Operators
>   - Functions and Return(first two lessons which is on MDN)

The extra thing included in the code doesn't mean I learnt them. I just had an idea seeing them from examples throughout my lessons and I also had a peep at arrays so I would be able to temporarily save inputs

#### End Note

I am sure you thing there is a better way to do this and probably you can do this in a better way which is good but this was not written on a professional basics so you are free to admire this work with the eyes of a complete beginner.

##### Words
_I don't care if there is a better way to do this as I would learn it later on as I progress. I am still sloppy at many things but I am open to advise if my code could have been structured in a better way, that's all. Thanks!!!_
